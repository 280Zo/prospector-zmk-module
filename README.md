# Prospector ZMK Module

This is a [ZMK module](https://zmk.dev/docs/features/modules) that provides custom status screen support for the [Prospector](https://github.com/carrefinho/prospector) display dongle.

![Four status screen layouts for Prospector](docs/images/status-screen-update-hero.png)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This branch is a work-in-progress and is only compatible with the Zephyr 4.1 version of ZMK (current main).

## Features

- Four status screen layouts to choose from
- Display blanks and backlight turns off on idle/sleep, then restores on activity
- Active layer display
- Peripheral battery status
- BLE profile and output indicator
- Active modifier display
- Caps word indicator

## Installation

Your ZMK keyboard should be set up with a dongle as central.

Add this module to your `config/west.yml` with these new entries under `remotes` and `projects`:

```yaml
manifest:
  remotes:
    - name: zmkfirmware
      url-base: https://github.com/zmkfirmware
    - name: carrefinho                            # <--- add this
      url-base: https://github.com/carrefinho     # <--- and this
  projects:
    - name: zmk
      remote: zmkfirmware
      revision: main
      import: app/west.yml
    - name: prospector-zmk-module                 # <--- and these
      remote: carrefinho                          # <---
      revision: feat/new-status-screens           # <---
  self:
    path: config
```

Then add the `prospector_adapter` shield to the dongle in your `build.yaml`:

```yaml
---
include:
  - board: xiao_ble//zmk
    shield: [YOUR KEYBOARD SHIELD]_dongle prospector_adapter
```

For more information on ZMK Modules and building locally, see [the ZMK docs page on modules.](https://zmk.dev/docs/features/modules)

## Status Screens

Classic is used by default. To choose a different screen, add one of the following to your `.conf` file:

```ini
CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_STATUS_SCREEN_RADII=y
CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_STATUS_SCREEN_FIELD=y
CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_STATUS_SCREEN_OPERATOR=y
```

## Usage

For split keyboards, the peripheral battery widget arranges sub-widgets in pairing order. After flashing the dongle, pair the left side first, then the right side. For more than two peripherals, pair them left to right.

The layer display shows the `display-name` property when available, falling back to the layer index otherwise. To add a `display-name` to a keymap layer:

```dts
keymap {
  compatible = "zmk,keymap";
  base {
    display-name = "Base";           # <--- add this
    bindings = <
      ...
    >;
  }
}
```

## Idle Timeout (Display + Backlight)

`CONFIG_ZMK_IDLE_TIMEOUT` controls when ZMK transitions from `ACTIVE` to `IDLE` after no input activity.

To blank the display at idle, also enable:

```ini
CONFIG_ZMK_DISPLAY_BLANK_ON_IDLE=y
```

When that timeout is reached:
- ZMK display blanking turns the screen off.
- Prospector backlight is set to `0`.

`CONFIG_ZMK_DISPLAY_BLANK_ON_IDLE` affects display blanking only. Backlight shutoff is handled by this module on `IDLE`/`SLEEP` activity events.

When activity returns:
- The display is unblanked by ZMK.
- Backlight is restored by this module:
  - fixed mode: `CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_FIXED_BRIGHTNESS`
  - ambient mode: current sensor-driven brightness

Set the timeout in your dongle `.conf` file (value is in milliseconds):

```ini
# 60 seconds of inactivity before IDLE
CONFIG_ZMK_IDLE_TIMEOUT=60000
CONFIG_ZMK_DISPLAY_BLANK_ON_IDLE=y
```

Optional: if you also use ZMK sleep behavior, this module handles both `IDLE` and `SLEEP` by keeping the backlight off until activity resumes.

## Configuration

To customize, add config options to your `.conf` file:
```ini
CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_USE_AMBIENT_LIGHT_SENSOR=n
CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_FIXED_BRIGHTNESS=80
```

### General
| Name | Description | Default |
| ---- | ----------- | ------- |
| `CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_ROTATE_DISPLAY_180` | Rotate the display 180 degrees | n |
| `CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_USE_AMBIENT_LIGHT_SENSOR` | Use ambient light sensor for auto brightness | y |
| `CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_FIXED_BRIGHTNESS` | Fixed display brightness when not using ambient light sensor | 50 (1-100) |
| `CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_LAYER_NAME_UPPERCASE` | Convert layer names to uppercase (Operator and Radii only) | y |
| `CONFIG_ZMK_IDLE_TIMEOUT` | Inactivity time before ZMK enters `IDLE` (backlight turns off; display blanking also requires `CONFIG_ZMK_DISPLAY_BLANK_ON_IDLE`) | ZMK default |

> [!NOTE]
> Prospector display backlight is forced to `0` when ZMK enters `IDLE` or `SLEEP`, and restored when activity returns to `ACTIVE`.
> In fixed mode it restores to `CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_FIXED_BRIGHTNESS`; in ambient-light mode it restores to the current sensor-driven brightness.

### Modifiers
| Name | Description | Default |
| ---- | ----------- | ------- |
| `CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_SHOW_MODIFIERS` | Display modifier key indicators | y |
| `CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_SHOW_INACTIVE_MODIFIERS` | Show inactive modifiers dimmed (Classic and Field only) | y |
| `CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_MODIFIER_ORDER` | Order of modifiers: G=GUI, A=Alt, C=Ctrl, S=Shift | "GACS" |

### Field-specific
| Name | Description | Default |
| ---- | ----------- | ------- |
| `CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_ANIMATION_WPM_REFERENCE` | WPM value at which animation reaches max speed | 70 |
| `CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_ANIMATION_INTENSITY_DECAY_SEC` | Seconds for lines to fade out after typing stops | 30 |
| `CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_ANIMATION_FLOW_DECAY_SEC` | Seconds for line directions and length to settle | 300 |

## Troubleshooting

### RAM overflow error

If you encounter a `region 'RAM' overflowed` error when building, add the following to your `.conf` file to reduce the display buffer size:

```ini
CONFIG_LV_Z_VDB_SIZE=25
```

## Known Issues

- One peripheral may fail to register key presses after connecting to the dongle; reset the affected peripheral to fix. https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/issues/3156
- Operator, Radii: battery display only supports up to three peripherals

## To-Do

- Operator: per-profile BLE status
- Radii: document and improve color theme customization
- OS-specific modifier styles
- Caps lock indication
